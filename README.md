The **[Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX)](https://sdmx.org)** is used to exchange data and metadata in a standardised and efficient manner and was launched by several international organisations in 2001. This is achieved by providing standard formats for data and metadata, IT architecture for the exchange and content-oriented guidelines.

This project explores how to query data from [UNICEFâ€™s Indicator Data Warehouse](https://sdmx.data.unicef.org/overview.html) via API calls and explains the required concepts of the SDMX standard.
